### Bonjour/Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a first-year master's student in Computer Science at McGill University/Mila. My current research focuses on learning from preferential feedback.

I am broadly interested in designing "good", value-aligned objectives for agents that make decisions in evolving environments. I am fortunate to be supervised by the dynamic duo: Prakash Panangaden and Doina Precup.
Prior to my M.Sc, I completed a bachelor in Honours Mathematics at McGill and worked in Adrian Liu's cosmology group on computer vision for astrophysics.

For a list of publications and preprints, see my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IRKWTTwAAAAJ&hl=en).

Thanks for stopping by!
